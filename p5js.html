                    In this project, we were asked to make an image of something others lost before. My interpretation of the losing object
                    It's a golden ring with darker words written on it, and it's shiny. I explored how to use many different shapes in p5, and tryed to get the effect i want and conbined them together.

                    my sketsh is based on the outlet in the US. I found it looks like an unsatisfied face.So in this assignment I use this face and made it looks angry by letting the component of his face shaking. whats I discovered in this assignment is how to combine the "random" and "mouseMoving" effect to get to the feeling I want.

                <p>
                    My experimental clock is half of an apple. It tracks time my showing how oxidixed the exposing part of the apple is. As the time goes by, the apply will turn from light yellow to brown, which indicates from fresh to oxidixed. It's novel to me because it's not an electronic clock, it use it's natural chemical reaction to show time. In this project I'm more familiar with the process of makeing those shapes and useing cilp().I used lerpColor to make it changes color.

                    We made our own characters and we were asked to combine three of them together to make a new one. My corpse is made of a bird, a butterfly and a robot. I think the hardest part of this assignment it's too think of a way to connect those body parts together. Eventually I used blendMode to indicate the connection.

                    I origionally designed to use mouse to change the size of the dark circles to create the "lights out" effect. I found the shape looks like cereals so I change the colors to delious candy colors.

                <p>
                    I track down the data of how much I want to eat a bagel every day in a week and I also count the amount of begal I ate in each day of the week. I spent a lot of time think how to visualize my data because my date or my number list are only made of small numbers, it's hard to make them look interesting just by making charts. So I came up with the I idea of drawing real bagels, and the same amount as the date and significant size change can make it clearer and more attractive.

                <p>
                    My dogs have been one of the most important part of my life, so I made this a game about the story of how I got my first dog. In this assignment, I get the chance to try many different things, I learn how to upload image and making pixel art, I also learnt the functions like class, scence swith and stuff. Most important like I get to know how to make a simple little game.
